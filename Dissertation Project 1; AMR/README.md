# Small Instructions and Help

* Open R project to set working directory
* Run code in setup folder in order. Code should be self-contained, in that other files are sourced when dependencies are missing.

## Side Notes:

Template folder contains image for LaTeX document. 
Code_2 missing - was a folder with experiments inside, did not feed into final report. It involved some of the prototyping for Code_3.
