    "In my_det(), the 'n' should be calculated inside the function, as it is dependent entirely on 'A'. Its calculation would be simple, using the 𝚕𝚎𝚗𝚐𝚝𝚑() function on the first element of the input array. It should be put in the docstring for my_det() that A should be square, and there could also be error handling for a non-square input. Additionally, the base case should be for n=2, as it is simply (ad-bc). Changing the base case to this reduces the number of function calls, and the number of elementary operations - improving the efficiency. Still with my_det(), $\\texttt{from numpy import *}$ is advised against in Python. When examining the code in future, it is harder to discern which functions and methods are from numpy. Furthermore, if a user wishes to add to the script, they must be careful not to overwrite any numpy objects with their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the user has failed to create a docstring in my_det(), as docstrings are created with triple quotes. Even supposing it worked, the ‘docstring’ is not descriptive. For example it fails to mention what type and dimensions arguments should be. Similarly, the docstring for paraVol() is poor, for the same reason. Following on from the theme of comments, \"#implement the formula\" is pointless, as it describes nothing. Something like \"Calculate the determinant of A recursively using expansion of the first column\" would provide more detail to readers. \"#print(C)\" is poorly styled, and is a debugging technique that should not have been left in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function names are inconsistent which is poor style. PEP8 recommends lower case words separated by underscores, but the user should focus on keeping the names consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The style for paraVol() is poor - the matrix construction should be broken up onto multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brief says \"without using the inbuilt functions”, but the code for my_det() uses the numpy function delete(). Additionally, the code for both functions does not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider my_det(), and the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n",
    "1 & 2\\\\\n",
    "2 & 4\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows are linearly dependent, meaning a 0 determinant, but applying my_det() to this matrix returns a determinant of -4. The way to fix the function is by adding 1 to the upper end of the loop range, and adding 1 to the exponent of -1 in the updating of 'det'. We need the loop to occur n times, as the formula states. The exponents are a mathematical tool, so their values should relate to indexing starting at 1 (as we do in mathematics when considering matrices), instead of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding paraVol(), negative volumes are possible, as determinants can be negative. This can be fixed with the abs() function, assuming my_det() works correctly.It also accepts arguments from higher dimensional space than 3D, which would not be a parallelepiped.  \n",
    "\n",
    "paraVol() combines the the first 3 elements of each argument array into a matrix, and calculates the determinant of that matrix to return the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_det() recurisvely calculates the determinant, with the base case being n=1  (A is mathematically scalar). If A is non-scalar, the code deletes row index 'i' and column 1 (index j), and uses the given formula to get the determinant of the reduced matrix in the same way until the base case. Once the determinant of the reduced matrix has been calculated, the determinant of the current matrix is updated as per the formula. This is repeated for all rows."

The K-nearest-neighbours algorithm is a classic machine learning algorithm used for [classification problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification). Classifying a data item from a given dataset means deciding which of a number of classes the item belongs to. This is done using a *training set*, containing a number of data items with known class.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each item in the dataset, we find the 3 nearest items (and their respective classes) in the training set. We then attribute a class to our data item by majority voting amongst the classes of the 3 nearest neighbours. In the case where three classes are tied in the vote, we resolve the tie by choosing the class of whichever neighbour is the nearest in the training set. (In practice this might not be a very good thing to do - but we are just constructing a simple implementation for now). Finally, we need to output the class we have decided on for each item in our original dataset.\n",

The lists containing each item of the dataset should use appropriate types for each element of the list. \n",
    "- **`dist_vect(item,train_data)`** which takes as arguments one element of the list `main_data`, and the list `train_data`, both from the output of the data_setup function. The function should calculate the Euclidean distance from item in the dataset to each item in the training dataset in order. The function should return a list of (distance, class) tuples.\n",
    "- **`decide_class(dv)`** which takes the output list of tuples of the dist_vect function as an argument, and uses it to return the class of the item in the dataset.\n",
