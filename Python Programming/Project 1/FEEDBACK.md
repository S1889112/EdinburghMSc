For Q1, your answer would benefit from more formatting e.g. headers, bullet-points. You catch the algorithmic errors but did not discuss the irregular indentation, which is important in Python. 

Very good answer for Q2 - your docstrings were very thorough, and all your answers for classes were correct. Well done.
