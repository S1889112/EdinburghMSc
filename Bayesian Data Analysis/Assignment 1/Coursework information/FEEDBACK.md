1a) 5/5

 b) 4/5 Fine, but weights can be computed exactly.

 c) 6/8 Posterior distribution plots and trace plots should have bee included within the answers.

 d) 5/6 Some analytic statement about relationship between probability that one value is less than 0 and 1 of 5 less than 0 was needed.

 e) 3/6 Marginal distribution on w not correct. No attempt to explain why marginals take the form they do.


2a) 4/6 Prior choice is OK, but doesn't make proper use of prior knowledge. Can choose Gamma parameters so that distibution (in log-rate) is flat at low values and then drops off at 1000 which is better than the arbitrary uninformative choice made here.

 b) 6/6

 c) 1/2 Probability incorrect for the stated posterior (also inconsistent with value stated in Table!).

 d) 5/5

 e) 7/8 Conclusion not quite right - 11% is not significant, but merely suggestive that we should collect more data to test this properly.

 f) 7/8 Good, but an explicit model for a rate that changes with time should have been given for the last part.


3a) 3/5 Exploratory data analysis was reasonable, but no transformations considered.

 b) 5/5

 c) 3/5 When using scaled covariates should undo scaling of parameters, or explicitly give scaling factors. Needed to include plots of posterirs and chain plots for some cases.

 d) 5/5

 e) 5/5

 f) 5/5

 g) 3/5 Some more discussion of other modifications to the model, such as using Normal errors or transformations was needed.
