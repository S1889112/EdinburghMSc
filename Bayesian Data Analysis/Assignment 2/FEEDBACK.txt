Very complete. Congratulations!﻿﻿﻿﻿

Q1.a - 3/3

Q1.b - 8/10

You should briefly discuss the SD/MCMC error ratio.

You should interpret the posterior estimate of beta0 (exp(beta0) is the expected counts for the central year of the data).

Q1.c - 9/9

Q1.d - 4/5

The impact of beta2 should not be judged by its absolute magnitude. Exp(beta2) expresses the increasing factor for the response variable per unit of the explanatory variable. ﻿Quantification of the impact of beta2 should be given. E.g.:  An increase of 100 Yellow-legged gulls is associated with a factor exp(100*beta2), estimated to be 1.5 (a 50% increase).


Q1.e - 12/12

Q1.f - 5/5


Q2.a - 3/3

Q2.b - 7/12


Permeability is a factor. It should have been transformed into 0/1 to be correctly interpretable.

You should briefly discuss the SD/MCMC error ratio.

Economical significance﻿ is wrongly interpreted. On the one side, the sign of the parameter does not make the factor less "economically significant", that is, the impact is still the same but in the reversed way. On the other side, the absolute values of the parameters are not comparable (unless the covariates have been standardized, which is not the case).﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

Q3   - 11/12

The model is definitely a downgrade from the already ﻿﻿﻿fitted models.

Nice ﻿estimation of the probability of the parameters having the same sign as the mean to give an idea of the relevance of the parameter﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿!﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

Good discussion.﻿﻿﻿
